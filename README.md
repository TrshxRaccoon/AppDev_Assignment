# AppDev Assignment

# Flutter Task: Basic Input and Display

## Objective
Create a Flutter app that takes input from a user via a text field and displays it on the screen (in either an alert box, a snack bar, or within the app body itself) when a button is pressed.

---

## To create a new Flutter project:
   ```bash
   flutter create flutter_demo
  ```
## Alternatively:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.  
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the Command Palette.  
3. Type `Flutter: New Project` and select it.  
4. Choose the project type (use **Flutter Application** for now).  
5. Enter the project name.  
6. Select the folder where you want to create the project.  
7. Wait for VS Code to create the project and fetch dependencies.
