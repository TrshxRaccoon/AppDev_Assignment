# Flutter Assignments

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Practice basic Flutter concepts by building small widgets and apps.  
Each assignment is simple and focused on one feature.

---

### Assignment 1: Hello World App
- Create a Flutter app that shows **"Hello World"** in at the top and centre of the screen.
- Hint: Use `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `Center`.

---

### Assignment 2: Text Input & Display
- Add a `TextField` where the user types input.
- Add a button that, when pressed, shows the typed text on the screen.
- Hint: Use a `TextEditingController`.

---

### Assignment 3: Simple ListView
- Show a scrollable list of items (e.g., fruits).
- Each item should be in a `Card` with padding.

---

### Assignment 4: Navigation
- Create two screens.
- Add a button on the first screen that navigates to the second screen.
- Hint: Use `Navigator.push`.

---

### âœ¨ Bonus
- Combine **Assignment 2 (input)** and **Assignment 3 (list)**:  
  Let the user add new items to a list by typing in the `TextField`.
